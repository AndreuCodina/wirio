## Features
- **Use it everywhere:** Use dependency injection in web servers, background tasks, console applications, Jupyter notebooks, tests, etc.
- **Lifetimes**: `Singleton` (same instance per application), `Scoped` (same instance per HTTP request scope) and `Transient` (different instance per resolution).
- **FastAPI integration** out of the box, and pluggable to any web framework.
- **Automatic resolution and disposal**: Automatically resolve constructor parameters and manage async and non-async context managers. It's no longer your concern to know how to create or dispose services.
- **Clear design** inspired by one of the most used and battle-tested DI libraries, adding async-native support, important features and good defaults.
- **Centralized configuration**: Register all services in one place using a clean syntax, and without decorators.
- **ty** and **Pyright** strict compliant.
