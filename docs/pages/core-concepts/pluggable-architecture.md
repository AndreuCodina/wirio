# Pluggable architecture

## Overview

`Wirio` follows the same extension-friendly design that ASP.NET Core popularized. Rather than hiding registrations behind a monolithic container, the library exposes the `ServiceCollection` and encourages features to be layered through small, self-contained modules. This lets applications opt into only the capabilities they need while keeping configurations declarative and easy to reason about.

## ServiceCollection as the Composition Root

- `ServiceCollection` is the single aggregation point for all services. Each feature contributes registrations by receiving an instance of the collection and calling standard helpers.
- The resulting graph is immutable once `build_service_provider()` is invoked, ensuring the runtime container is predictable and thread-safe.
- Because everything flows through the collection, reusable packages can add services without assuming how the host application instantiates the provider.

## ServiceCollection extensions (`add_*` helpers)

We, or the own libraries we use, can provide functions that accept a `ServiceCollection` and register the required services. For example, a logging package might expose an `add_logging` function, providing good defaults and injectable services:

```python
def add_logging(services: ServiceCollection) -> None:
    services.add_singleton(LoggerFactory, DefaultLoggerFactory)
    services.add_transient(Logger)
```

Similarly, an observability package could offer an `add_observability` function:

```python
def add_observability(services: ServiceCollection) -> None:
    services.add_singleton(MetricsClient, PrometheusMetricsClient)
    services.add_singleton(Tracer, OtelTracer)
```

The `sqlmodel` library might provide by default the `add_sqlmodel` extension, which sets up SQLModel, so all the typical boilerplate is handled for us with just a single line of code:

```python
def add_sqlmodel(services: ServiceCollection, connection_string: str) -> None:
    def inject_async_engine() -> AsyncEngine:
        return create_async_engine(connection_string)

    def inject_async_sessionmaker(
        async_engine: AsyncEngine,
    ) -> async_sessionmaker[AsyncSession]:
        return async_sessionmaker(
            async_engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False
        )

    def inject_async_session(
        async_sessionmaker: async_sessionmaker[AsyncSession],
    ) -> AsyncSession:
        return async_sessionmaker()


    services.add_singleton(inject_async_engine)
    services.add_singleton(inject_async_sessionmaker)
    services.add_transient(inject_async_session)
```

And then our `main.py` would be:

```python
services = ServiceCollection()
add_logging(services)
add_observability(services)
add_sqlmodel(services, connection_string="...")
```

In a real application, we might have:

```python
services = ServiceCollection()
application_settings = ApplicationSettings()
services.add_singleton(ApplicationSettings, application_settings)
add_logging(services)
add_observability(services)
add_sqlmodel(
    services,
    connection_string=application_settings.database_connection_string,
)
```

As a note, if we created our own `add_sqlmodel` extension, the code would be even shorter because we can reuse the `ApplicationSettings` instance already registered in `ServiceCollection`:

```python hl_lines="8"
def add_sqlmodel(services: ServiceCollection) -> None:
    def inject_async_engine(application_settings: ApplicationSettings) -> AsyncEngine:
        return create_async_engine(application_settings.postgresql_connection_string)

    ...


add_sqlmodel(services)
```

## Why not a Container subclass?

Other libraries embrace a container-class API: we extend a `Container`, override methods, or mutate attributes to register services. That style works, but it comes with trade-offs that `Wirio` intentionally avoids:

- **Interoperability:** Both approaches technically work across frameworks, but the collection style keeps things primitive (just create an instance and start registering). Container subclasses introduce class-level state, overridden hooks, and metaclass magic that become friction points when we try to share the same container between, say, a CLI bootstrapper and an async worker, or application code and test cases.
- **Composability:** Collection-first helpers (`add_logging`, `add_sqlmodel`, etc.) compose like ordinary functions. Container subclasses tend to accumulate registration logic across inheritance hierarchies, making it harder to cherry-pick modules or share them between apps.
- **Predictability:** Once `build_service_provider()` runs, the provider is sealed. Container-class APIs often allow late mutation or rely on attribute access magic, which can hide ordering bugs.
- **Testability:** Tests can spin up a fresh `ServiceCollection`, register or override fakes, and build a provider in a few lines. When registrations sit inside container subclasses, swapping implementations usually means subclassing again or using custom hooks.

In short, the `ServiceCollection` model mirrors ASP.NET Core's ergonomics while staying idiomatic to Python: no inheritance requirements, just functional building blocks we can plug together as needed.

## How to structure feature packages

1. **Expose a single public entry point** (for example, `def add_feature(services: ServiceCollection, **options) -> None`).
2. **Register abstractions, not concrete types.** Use interfaces in shared libraries, so consumers can replace implementations when needed.
3. **Keep configuration explicit.** Pass options via parameters or small dataclasses instead of global state.
4. **Document prerequisites.** If `add_sqlmodel` expects a configured `Engine`, accept it as a parameter or register a factory that builds one from provided settings.

## Putting it together

The end result is a plug-and-play ecosystem: logging, observability, data stores, caching, and custom application modules all plug into `ServiceCollection` the same way. This symmetry makes it trivial to port patterns from ASP.NET Core DI, reuse mental models, and share modules across Python services that embrace the dependency injection container.
